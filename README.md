# Whiskers-to-Keepsakes
When my beloved cat, Whiskers, lost a tooth, I wanted to keep a part of her with me forever. This small tooth, once a part of her playful purrs and gentle nuzzles, became a cherished keepsake. Inspired by this bond, I began creating unique jewelry pieces from pet teeth, turning memories into tangible treasures. Each piece is craft with your pet
